# Brain_Tumor_Detection
This project uses **Scikit-Learn**, **OpenCV**, and **NumPy** to detect brain tumors in MRI scans with **SVM** and **Logistic Regression** models. It aims to assist medical professionals in early tumor detection. Future improvements include deep learning, real-time predictions, and a more diverse dataset.
